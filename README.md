# Image_recognizing_macro
It does the repetitive work, but demanding to wait random time for each step is done.<br/>
This is done by waiting until some images pop up to the screen.<br/>
This is made for specific work I've done while I was working, hence not suitable for general works.<br/>
Codes are not uploaded due to security.<br/>
Java, OpenCV is used.<br/>
