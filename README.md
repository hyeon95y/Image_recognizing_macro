# Image_recognizing_macro
• Done as a personal project during working in a finance company<br/>
• It does the repetitive work, but requiring to wait random time for each step is done.<br/>
• This is done by waiting until some images pop up to the screen.<br/>
• This program is designed for specific work I'd done while I was working, hence not suitable for general works.<br/>
• Entire Code is not uploaded due to company security policy, only core classes are included.<br/>
• Java, OpenCV is used.<br/>
• Done in 2015~2016
